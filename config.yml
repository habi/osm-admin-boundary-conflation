# If True, scripts will just assess conflation potential and will not submit anything to OSM.
# If False, there will be actual process of OSM submission. In that case, please set "auto_proceed" to false, so you
# can control process after each way.
dry_run: True

# Should human control stepping up after each processed way. Set to true when actually submitting to OSM.
auto_proceed: True

# If way is eligable for conflation, and some other nodes/ways relations are glued to it, should we unglue them.
# If you unglue them, you will get two ways with same geometries (with different tags, of course). If you set this to False,
# ways will be reported as not eligible for conflation.
unglue_ways_as_needed: True

# How far apart any endpoints of the way should be from OSM way to consider them eligable for conflation.
# If any endpoint is in greater distance than this, script will not conflate this road. If you set this too low,
# lot of ways that could be conflated will be reported as not possible. If you set this too high, you might get false
# positives and wrong ways could be conflated by error.
